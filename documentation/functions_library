Textual I/O
Format: value-command-parameter
	Values:
		't' - current temperature in °F/°C ("The current temperature is 50°F / 10°C")
		'c' - current carbon monoxide concentration ("The current CO concentration is 15ppm")
		'l' - Google Maps link ("Your car is here: maps.google.com/maps?q=LAT+LONG")
	Commands:
		'n' - execute command now (instantaneous read)
		'p' - execute command periodically
	Parameter (only applicable to 'p' command):
		"#" - time delay in ms
			
			
Arduino response:
	understood command: print out requested value
	misunderstood command: "invalid command, please try again"
	

	
Natural Language Functions ("natlang" - "v-c-p command"):
	"temp" - "t-n"
	"temperature" - "t-n"
	"co" - "c-n"
	"loc" - "l-n"
	"location" - "l-n"
	*** appending "every #unit" adds a "-p-#" to the v-c-p command ***
	example: "temp every 5m" - "t-p-300000" (print temp every 5 minutes)
	example: "location every 2h" - "l-p-7200000" (print location every 2 hours)
	understood units:
		'l', "milli", "milliseconds"
		's', "sec", "seconds"
		'm', "min", "minutes"
		'h', "hr", "hours"
		'd', "dy", "days"
		'w', "wk", "weeks"
